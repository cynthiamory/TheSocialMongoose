## Description

This application serves as the foundation for a full-stack social network application. It utilizes a MongoDB database, Express.js routing, and the Mongoose ODM. The primary purpose is to establish the initial CRUD API routes for the application, enabling users to perform operations such as creation, searching, updating, and deletion. Additionally, users can engage in various activities, including sharing their thoughts, reacting to friends' thoughts, creating friend lists, and managing their own content. While the application is still in its early stages, the integration of MongoDB database and API middleware routing represents a crucial initial step in exploring the potential of MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM.

## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
```
